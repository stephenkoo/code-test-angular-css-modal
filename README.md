Hi Rotarors,

This is my attempt at your design spec challenge.

I had fun (though some CSS layout troubles had me pulling my hair out).

## Brief
We would like you to provide the HTML and associated code for a cut-up that our designer has supplied.  The end result should look like the image (autoscheduler-priorities.jpg).  

### Instructions:
The designer has supplied all the relevant information in a text file (about.rtf) along with the graphic for the 'tick'.

Extra points will be awarded for adding code to handle re-ordering the entries and if you can demonstrate any skills you have in Javascript libraries such as Angular.

Please ensure that the final code is packaged up and can be run from our developer machines (including any additional resources required).

## Demo
You can find a working demo here **[on this gh-page](https://stephenkoo.github.io/code-test-angular-css-modal/autoscheduler/)**.

## Code evaluation and areas of improvement
In my first iteration, I hardcoded everything in html so I could focus on CSS first (see noAngular.html).

I've managed to list the priorities using Angular, but haven't quite figured out building custom drag & drop sortable functionality.

I was tempted to use [these directives](https://github.com/marceljuenemann/angular-drag-and-drop-lists) but decided to fully understand the code first. 

Would love to see how you guys approached building this modal - especially the Angular side.
