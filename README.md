Hi Rotarors,

This is my attempt at your challenge.
I had fun (though some CSS layout troubles had me pulling my hair out).

# Demo
You can find a working demo here **[on this gh-page](https://stephenkoo.github.io/code-test-angular-css-modal/autoscheduler/)**.

In my first iteration, I hardcoded everything in html so I could focus on CSS first (see noAngular.html).

I've managed to list the priorities using Angular, but haven't quite figured out building custom drag & drop sortable functionality.

I was tempted to use [these directives](https://github.com/marceljuenemann/angular-drag-and-drop-lists) but decided to fully understand the code first. 

Would love to see how you guys approached building this modal - especially the Angular side.
